      I'm Cassio Cardoso, a software engineer specialized in front-end
      development with 8+ years of experience. I'm a brazilian guy from a small

      Throughout my career I've had the opportunity to do web development in
      general, as well as design, business and management and I'm really happy
      to be able to enjoy all of these areas. Each of them needed a specific
      skill-set and it provided me with a lot of opportunities to grow and
      learn.

      PHP and MySQL and front-end with jQuery and Bootstrap.

      <dt>Favorite hobby?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          I'm a sports guy. I've played soccer my entire youth and I always
          enjoyed the feeling of being part of a team and the adrenaline during
          the games.

          From 2010 until 2015 I founded and played in a flag football team in

          this was a great experience where I was able to make a lot of friends

      <dt>Favorite game?</dt>
      <dd>
        I'm a Pok√©mon fanatic. This is, by far, my favorite game series and I
        enjoy playing it, both on 3DS and also Pok√©mon Go! I like the idea of
        exploring some new park or part of the city while playing the game. But,
        if I had to choose one game to be my number one it would be Pok√©mon Y.
      </dd>
      <dt>Favorite musical style?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          I like rock 'n' roll ü§ò a lot, so I'm usually listening bands from the
          70s, 80s and 90s like AC/DC, Queen, Metallica. I also enjoy pop,
          pop-rock, and similar styles. My favorite bands nowadays are Muse and
          Imagine Dragons.
        </p>
        <p>
          While working-out I listen to a lot of rap and hip-hop songs, they
          give me that extra motivation to go through the exercises.
